How Does It Works?

1. DEFINE INTETNTS. 
We have defined our intent in intents.json, with a tag and pattern, this help us for the training of the model.

2. NLTK.
We use the nltk librery to work with the words (nltk_utils.py), in particular we use nltk to tokenize and stem the text.

3. TRAINING OF THE MODEL.
Now we want to train the model (train.py), so we import the function we had written in nltk_utils.py.
We use pytorch

4. CREATE OUR NEURAL NETWORK.
We use a feed forward nn. The input layer is fully-connected, it has the number of pattern as dimension, then we have 2 hidden layer, then we have an output layer with the number of classes. In the end we apply a softmax to get y.
